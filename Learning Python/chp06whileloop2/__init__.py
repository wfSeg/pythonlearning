#another while loop example

ei=7
while ei != 0:
    print ei
    ei=ei-1
    print "Wow, now ei now equals",ei
print "This ends everything."

#note, everything indented under while runs in the loop, while
#the condition is not met. Once it's met, then last
#line execute. If you have last line indented, it will run
#with each loop
